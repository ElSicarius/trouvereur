# FindAllLinks
A tool to extract all the urls and paths found in the content of a page (js/html sources included)

# /!\
This tool is still in dev. The main regex used for finding paths might also create a lot of noise. I'm still working on it ! but i'm sure, if you look closely to the results, you'll see the golden gem.
