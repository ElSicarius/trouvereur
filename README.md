# linktrouvereur
A tool to extract all the urls and paths found in the content of a page (js/html sources included)

# /!\
This tool is still in dev. The main regex used for finding paths might also create a lot of noise. I'm still working on it ! but i'm sure, if you look closely to the results, you'll see the golden gem.

# install
chrome store:  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trouvereur/ecakpoecmehpjhpgfndlkhahedcembki

from the sources:

- clone the repo
- go in chrome -> chrome://extensions
- clic "load unpacked extension"
- select the 0.1 directory
- enjoy
